Library\\WMI\\Java.description=<pre>\nThe operations interact with Windows servers in a variety of ways.\n\nDeployment Requirements\:\nWindows or Linux RAS\n\nInterfaces/APIs Used\:\nWMI for Windows RAS, J-Interop for Linux RAS\n\nNotes\:\n1. Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7  have enhanced the security with the introduction of Windows Resource Protection (WRP) so that the registry keys that need to be updated to enable remote WMI access (WBEM Scripting Locator) are locked down and can only be accessed by a Trusted Installer. In order to run Java WMI operations against a target host with these operating systems you must execute the following steps\: \n    1.1. Launch 'regedit.exe' as 'Administrator'.\n    1.2. Find the following registry key\: 'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\76A64158-CB41-11d1-8B02-00600806D9B6' corresponding to the WBEM Scripting Locator.\n    1.3. Right click and select 'Permissions'.\n    1.4. Click the 'Advanced' button.\n    1.5. Select the tab labeled 'Owner'.\n    1.6. Change the owner to 'Administrator'.\n    1.7. Click the 'Ok' button.\n    1.8. Now highlight the 'Administrators' group and grant Full Control.\n    1.9. Click 'Ok'.\n    1.10. The first time you run a Java WMI operation against this host, the 'Server' and 'Remote Registry' services must be running because the host will be configured for DCOM access. \n\n2. In order to run the Java WMI operations with other users than Administrator you should make sure they have enough privileges to access DCOM, the WMI namespace and the WBEM Scripting Locator registry key. If you have any problems check that the following settings are made\:\n    2.1. The user is in the Administrators group.\n    2.2. UAC (User Access Control) should be disabled because it affects the execution of the WMI operations\: http\://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa826699%28v\=VS.85%29.aspx.\n    2.3. The computer is enabled for remote WMI connections\: http\://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa393266.aspx .\n\n</pre>
