Library\\PowerShell.description=<pre>\nThis folder contains a series of PowerShell operations. \n\nPowerShell must be installed on the host computer before any of these operations are executed. If PowerShell operations are used to execute on remote hosts, PowerShell should be also installed on the target host.\n\nThe PowerShell folder contains several sub-folders grouped by functionality\: Events, Networking, Services, Shares, Utility etc. The PowerShell Script operation can be used to run user defined scripts. Get Execution Policy and Set Execution Policy can be used to get and set execution policies for PowerShell operations.\n\nSome of the operations do not work on PowerShell 1.0 and require PowerShell 2.0 or later to be installed.\n\nRequirements\:\nPowerShell 1.0\nWindows XP SP2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 SP1 and above, Windows Server 2008\n\nPowerShell 2.0\nWindows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1 and above, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP1 and above\n\nPowerShell 3.0\nWindows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8\n\nPowerShell 4.0\nWindows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8.1\n\nVersions Supported\:\n1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\n\nPowerShell is available at http\://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/pages/download-windows-powershell.aspx\n\nInterfaces/APIs Used\:\nPowerShell Cmdlets, WMI, WinRM\n\nNotes\: \nIn order to use SSL input set on true the target machine should be prepared to listen on PowerShell through HTTPS, with default port 5986.\n1. Create a self-signed certificate on target machine.\n2. Import that certificate on the host that is running OO flows.\n3. Prepare PowerShell for remote communication on both machines\: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned; Enable-PSRemoting and Set-Item wsman\:\\localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts -Value *\n4. Create a PowerShell Listener on target machine\: winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address\=*+Transport\=HTTPS @{Hostname\="FQDN";CertificateThumbprint\="Certificate_Thumbprint"\nwhere FQDN is Fully Qualified Domain Name and Certificate_Thumbprint is a group of 20 hexadecimal symbols taken from certificate details.\n5. Verify the presence of HTTPS Listener on target machine with\: winrm/config/listener\n6. Set the PowerShell target machine in HTTPS communicating mode (ready to use SSL input set on true)\: Enter-PSSession -Computer FQDN -Credential Domain\\Administrator -UseSSL\n7. Run the flows with host input set with FQDN.\n8. For security reasons, we recommend using PowerShell through HTTPS with at least Basic authentication method.\n\nIn order to connect to a target machine through HTTP\:\n1. Run the followings PowerShell commands on target machine (server/remote host)\:\nEnable-PSRemonting\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\nSet-Item WSMan\:\\localhost\\Service\\TrustedHosts -Value <source_machine_IP>\nSet-Item WSMan\:\\localhost\\Service\\AllowUnencrypted -Value true\nSet-Item WSMan\:\\localhost\\Service\\Auth\\<authMethod> -Value true\n\n2. Then run the followings PowerShell commands on source machine (Studio/Central/RAS)\:\nEnable-PSRemonting\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\nSet-Item WSMan\:\\localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts -Value <target_machine_IP>\nSet-Item WSMan\:\\localhost\\Client\\AllowUnencrypted -Value true\nSet-Item WSMan\:\\localhost\\Client\\Auth\\<authMethod> -Value true\n\n3. PowerShell can be also configured through winrm (Windows Remote Management) utility\:\nwinrm quickconfig\ny\nwinrm set winrm/config/service/Auth @{Basic\="true"}\nwinrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted\="true"}\nwinrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB\="1024"}\n\n</pre>
