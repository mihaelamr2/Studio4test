Library\\PowerShell\\Remoting.description=<pre>\nThis folder contains a series of operations which can be used to test and enable PowerShell remoting in an enterprise. \nYou should use "Test PowerShell Remoting" operation before runnning "PowerShell Script". After testing PowerShell remoting, you can use the other operations to set WinRM client and service policies which will enable PowerShell remoting and the desired authentication types.\nIn most of the cases a reboot or WinRM service restart is required before the policies are actually applied. \nMake sure "Group Policy Management Console" (gpmc.msc) is available on the RAS machine if you want to set domain group policies. This feature should be available on the domain controller, but it is not enabled by default on the terminal servers.\n\nInterfaces/APIs Used\:\nPowerShell 2.0+\nWMI\nMicrosoft Group Policy Management API\n</pre>
