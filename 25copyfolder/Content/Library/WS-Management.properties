Library\\WS-Management.description=The operations in this folder can be used to interact with WS-Management compliant web services. The operations allow the client to\:\n    - get, put, create or delete individual management resources\n    - iterate over a collection of resources\n    - communicate with server through HTTP and HTTPS\n\nWinRM (Windows Remote Management) service implements the WS-Management protocol and its methods can be consumed using the operation in this folder.\n\nVersions Supported\:\nWS-Management 1.0.0\n\nDeployment Requirements\:\nRAS\n\nInterfaces/APIs Used\:\nWiseman 1.0\n\nConfiguration Steps\:\nFor HTTP communication\:\n    If you want to use the WinRM service you need to configure the service and reduce some of its security constraints.\n    1. Install WinRM on the host, if not already installed.\n    2. Open a command line and type "winrm quickconfig" which will set up a default configuration.\n    3. Type "winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic\="true"}" in order to enable basic authentication on the server.\n    4. Type "winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted\="true"} " in order to allow it to receive unencrypted messages.\n\nFor HTTPS communication\: \n    1.1 If you have a server certificate and a 'keystore' file where that certificate is stored, then provide the operations with that 'keystore' file.\n    1.2 If you have the certificate and need to create the keystore file, you can use 'keytool' from <OO_Home>/java/bin or <JAVA_HOME>\\bin to create a keystore and add your certificate to the keystore file.\nExamples\: \n    Create keystore\: keytool -keystore <path_to_keystore.jks> -genkey -alias <your_alias>\n\tAdd certificate to keystore\: keytool -importcert -file <path_to_certificate.cer> -keystore <path_to_keystore> -alias <your_alias>\n    2. If you need to create your certificate, use 'keytool' to create the certificate on the server.\nExample for creating a certificate with keytool\: \n\tkeytool -genkey -dname "cn\=Mark Jones, ou\=JavaSoft, o\=Sun, c\=US" \t\n      -alias business -keypass kpi135 -keystore C\:\\working\\mykeystore \t\n      -storepass ab987c -validity 180\n    3. You need to configure WinRM to accept https connections. Note that WinRM uses port 5985 for communication through http and 5986 for https. \n    To create a listener on WinRM for https you need to register the certificate that will be used for authentication.\nExample\: winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address\=*+Transport\=HTTPS @{Hostname\="serverfqdn";CertificateThumbprint\="fb 01 1b 62 15 98 44 d4 0e 66 ac d9 6d 7d d8 07 0a a5 5b 48"}\t
