Library\\MS\ Cluster\\PowerShell\\Cluster.description=<pre>\nThe operations from this folder enable performing common administrative tasks on failover clusters. Actions that can be performed are retrieving information about failover clusters, starting or stopping the Cluster service on all nodes in a cluster.\n\t\t\t\nThe following are some Powershell requirements and useful notes\:\n1. Installation of Powershell 2.0 with winrm 2.0 on your client is required. The kit can be downloaded from here\: http\://support.microsoft.com/kb/968930.\n2. Before using these operations, please make sure you have enabled PowerShell remoting, by using the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet.\n3. In workgroup environments, enabling classic mode authentication for network logons may be needed. This can be performed by opening the "Local Security Policy" from Control Panel and selecting "Administrative Tools". Navigate to "Local Policies" -> "Security Options", double click on "Network Access\: Sharing and Security Model for local accounts" and set it to classic.\n4. Also, please modify the WSMan trusted hosts setting, by adding the IP addresses of all remoting clients to the list of trusted hosts. This can be done using one of the following commands\:\n        4.1. Set-item wsman\:localhost\\client\\trustedhosts -value * (adds all computers as trusted hosts)\n        4.2. Set-item wsman\:localhost\\client\\trustedhosts -value Computer (only adds Computer to the trusted hosts)\n        4.3. Set-item wsman\:localhost\\client\\trustedhosts -value *.domain.com (adds all computers in the specified domain)\n        4.4. Set-item wsman\:localhost\\client\\trustedhosts -value 10.10.10.1 (adds the remote computer with the IP address 10.10.10.1 to the trusted hosts list)\n5. To enable CredSSP authentication, please follow the steps described below\:\n        5.1. Server side steps\:\n                - set CredSSP authentication to true, by using the Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server PowerShell command, or by using the winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{CredSSP\="true"}'  \t                  command line alternative\n                - create a new https listener by using the following commad\: winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address\=*+Transport\=HTTPS\n        5.2. Client side steps\:\n                - enable CredSSP authentication on the client, by running the command\: Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client -DelegateComputer WSMAN/*\n                - allow delegating fresh credentials by performing the following steps. Open gpedit.msc and go to Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Credentials Delegation. Enable "Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials" and add the wsman hosts to the server list. Run gpupdate /force from command line to force policy update.\n        5.3. Domain Controller side steps\:\n                - if the NETWORK SERVICE doesn't have "Validated write to service principal name", either try running the following command\: dsacls "CN\=AdminSDHolder,CN\=System,DC\=domain,DC\=com" /G "S-1-5-20\:WS;Validated write to service principal name" or open ADUC, go to Computers -> DC object -> Security, select Network Service and give it "Validated write to SPN".\n</pre>
